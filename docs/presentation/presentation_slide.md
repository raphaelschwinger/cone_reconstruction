## Project Overview:

- About "Rosyard" project
- Race-Car discription
- Race-track discription
- The SLAM algorithm

---

### Introduction:

- To optimize the SLAM algorithm it needs an accurate ground truth of the track and the position of the car during a test race.
- This task of ground truth generation is divided into two subtasks.
  - A ground truth of the race track has to be generated.
  - The position of the car while racing as to be aquired.
- The Goal of the project is to design an algorithm that calculates the corresponding ground truth of the racecar.

---

- ### Possible methods
  - **UWB based Triangulation** : Using UWB to trigulate car's position. Similar technology of AirTag but we do not have enough techincal knowledge for implementation.
  - **LiDAR** : More accurate but expensive.
  - **GPS** : High Accuracy GPS is expensive but already commercially available.
  - **Image based Triangulation** : Taking the position of the cones/car and using 3D scene reconstruction using images/videos of the race-track.

### 3D Reconstruction

- Structure from Motion: SLAM
  - simultaneous recover 3D structure and poses of cameras
- Input:
  - Image coordinates of objects for each camera
  - camera intrinsics (focal length, resolution, ...)
  - "real" position of at least 4 objects

---

#### Overview:

- first camera set to origin
- pose of second camera can be reconstructed with essential matrix $E = [t]_x R$ [^1]

```python
  E = cv2.findEssentialMat(points_2D_1, points_2D_2, cameraMatrix )
  R, t = cv2.recoverPose(E, points_2D_1, points2D_2, cameraMatrix)
```

#### Overview:

- 3D points can then be triangulated

```python
   points3D = cv2.triangulatePoints(P1, P2, points1, points2)
```

- for consecutive camera images $RÂ§ and $t$ can be recovered with Random sample consensus RANSAC algorithm
- Rodrigues can transform rotation vector in Rotation matrix

```python
rvecs, t = cv2.solvePnPRansac(points_3D, points_2D, cameraMatrix)
R= cv2.Rodrigues(rvecs)
```

---

#### Overview:

- further optimization can be achieved by using bundle adjustment
- we included `g2o` library for this purpose

## Reconstruction of the race-track using Blender :

- **Blender** :
  - Why Blender?
  - Scene Construction
    - Camera Settings : Focal length 15 mm
    - 4k resolution
  - Getting 2D cone and race-car's position point using scripts

---

## Affine transformation

## Tracking the racecar with OpenCV:

<!-- TODO: we need to give / research more detail here -->
<!-- TODO: add code, screenrecording -->

- **OpenCV Tracking Algorithm** :
  - KCF : Kernelized Correlation Filte is a novel tracking framework that utilizes properties of circulant matrix to enhance the processing speed.
  - CSRT : Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracking https://github.com/alanlukezic/csr-dcf

---

- Each tracker algorithm has their own advantages and disadvantages, but for us CSRT worked the best.

  <!-- TODO: add code, screenrecording -->

- **Color Tracking**
  - Tracking the Racecar based on its color. i.e: Red Color.

---

## Results:

<!-- TODO: add them to the slides and also add key outcomes, do that after we finished our results -->

- Video Demo of all the tracking methods.
- Result/Output of the tracking.
- Comparison graph of different trackers.

---

<!-- TODO: add them to the slides and also add key outcomes, do that after we finished our results -->

## Evaluation :

- MSE Graph
- Optimization error and plotted Graph

---

## Project Limiations:

- Using only Blender generated scene.
- Accuracy and noise of the real world are not considered.

---

## Conclusion :

- **Future prospects** :
  - Implementing the algorithm on a real-word scenario.
  - To improve the tracking accuracy we can try better methods. i.e: Train a CNN model using images of the Racecar
